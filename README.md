The explanation of each component and the idea of how they work.. as THE CODE IS UNFINISHED AS I RAN INTO SOME ISSUES AND WAS OCCUPIED WITH SOME OTHER THINGS.. no excuses but it is what it is. 

**1. Wallet Connection**
Overview:
The wallet connection component allows users to connect their Ethereum wallets (such as MetaMask or WalletConnect) to the application. This enables the application to interact with the blockchain, perform transactions, and fetch account details.

How It Works:

Web3Modal Library: We use Web3Modal to provide a seamless interface for connecting various wallet providers.
WalletConnect Provider: WalletConnect is used as an option for users who prefer mobile wallets.
Provider Initialization: The Web3Modal instance initializes with the available providers.
Connect Wallet: When a user clicks the "Connect Wallet" button, the application opens the wallet provider modal. Once the wallet is connected, the user's address and other details are fetched and displayed.
Integration:

The WalletConnector component is added to the main page, allowing users to connect their wallets.

**2. Cryptocurrency Price Charting**
Overview:
This component displays the historical and real-time prices of cryptocurrencies using interactive charts. Users can filter the data by day, week, or month to analyze price trends.

How It Works:

Charting Library: We use react-chartjs-2 and chart.js to create interactive charts.
API for Price Data: Historical price data is fetched from the CoinGecko API.
Real-time Updates: WebSocket connections are used to get real-time price updates, ensuring the chart reflects the latest market prices.
Integration:

The PriceChart component is added to the main page. It fetches initial data on component load and updates the chart in real-time using WebSocket connections.

**3. Token Swapping Mechanism**
Overview:
This component allows users to swap ERC-20 tokens directly within the application. It leverages decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols to facilitate token exchanges.

How It Works:

0x API: The 0x API is used to fetch exchange pair data and execute token swaps.
Token Approvals: Users need to approve the spending of their tokens, which is managed through the application.
Transaction Execution: Swap transactions are signed and executed, allowing users to exchange tokens seamlessly.
Integration:

The TokenSwap component is added to the main page, providing fields for inputting token details and initiating swaps.
Integration and Deployment
Directory Structure:
Ensure the components are organized in their respective folders (/components, /pages, /utils).

**Main Page Setup:**
The main page (index.tsx) imports and uses the components, displaying them in a user-friendly layout.

**API and WebSocket Utility Functions:**
Utility functions for fetching price data and managing WebSocket connections are placed in the /utils folder.
